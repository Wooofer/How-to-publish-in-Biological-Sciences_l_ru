# About the book
Publishing a paper in an academic journal should simply consist of submitting a publication worthy manuscript. But having a working knowledge of publishing will enable you to make better decisions about what, where and how to submit manuscripts. In this book, I explain the many choices that exist for those wishing to submit a manuscript for publication in the Biological Sciences. I describe publication bias, and how this is evidenced by reviewers and editors. Impact Factors and how the desire to track the performance of academics has led to unethical practices and exploitation of science and scientists. This guide provides an "everything you wanted to know about publishing but were afraid to ask" approach for anyone who still feels that there is more they need to know about publishing that might get them onto an even footing.
